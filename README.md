# Web Accessibility Project

We built this website as a project focused on web accessibility. The goal was to learn how to develop inclusive digital experiences that work for everyone, regardless of their functional ability.  
We worked with semantic HTML, proper use of ARIA attributes, clear color contrast, keyboard navigation, and responsive design.  
The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is published via Netlify.
