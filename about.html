    <h2>Contribute to a more inclusive web</h2>

    <p>
      This project gave me the opportunity to apply key accessibility principles
      and contribute to a more inclusive web. It’s been a valuable learning
      experience that really highlighted the importance of designing for all
      users. Here are some helpful links to documentation that can support you
      as a developer on your journey to prioritizing accessibility on the web
      and helping ensure equal opportunities for everyone.

    <h2>About this site</h2>

    <p>
      This website was created as part of a course focused on web accessibility
      – the practice of building websites that are usable for everyone,
      including those who use screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other
      assistive technologies. As part of the course, the task was to build a
      multiple-choice quiz with accessibility in mind. This project has been all
      about applying accessibility principles in practice, ensuring that the
      interface is not only functional, but also inclusive. Whether you're
      navigating with a mouse, a keyboard, or assistive tools, this site is
      designed to offer a smooth and user-friendly experience for all.
