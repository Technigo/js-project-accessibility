        This project is apart of Technigo's Web Bootcamp to further our knowleadge on Web accessibility tool.

        Our Web Accessibility page is an interactive webpage
        that demonstrates key accessibility principles in action. This webpage serves as a practical example
        of inclusive design, incorporating features such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color
        contrast adjustments.

        This page includes practice required WCAG guidelines, ARIA roles, and best practices for designing inclusive web
        experiences. By engaging with the quiz, users can assess their understanding and identify areas for improvement
        in creating accessible digital content.

      <p>
        Web accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with digital content
        effectively. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making websites more
        inclusive, covering areas like alt text for images, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.

        Alt text is essential for screen readers but should be avoided for decorative images by using alt="" .
        Informational images need descriptive alt text, while functional images (like icons) require alt text describing
        their purpose, such as alt= "Search".

        WCAG has three compliance levels: A, covering basic requirements like alt text; AA, ensuring better
        accessibility with features like proper color contrast; and AAA, the highest standard, including advanced
        features like sign language interpretation for videos. Most websites aim for AA compliance to balance
        accessibility and practicality.

        Clear language is key to accessibility. For example, “Flowers symbolize emotions and culture” is easier to
        understand than abstract phrases like “nature’s drip—bold and meaningful.” Simple, direct language benefits
        users with cognitive disabilities and screen reader users.

        Other best practices include keyboard-friendly navigation, ensuring text has at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio,
        and adding captions or transcripts for multimedia content. ARIA attributes like aria-label help improve screen
        reader navigation.

        By following WCAG guidelines, developers can create digital experiences that are inclusive, accessible, and
        user-friendly for everyone. Accessibility is about more than compliance—it’s about equal access for all.
