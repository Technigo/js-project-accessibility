        <h2>Our Team</h2>

        <h3>Malin "Mallan" Lundgren</h3>

        <p>After two months on an air mattress, the quality of life has now increased by about 47%. This is
          since
          the furniture, including the bed, from the USA finally arrived. Better sleep = next level coding!</p>
        <h3>Oscar "Oscar" Kling Liljefors</h3>

        <p>Without a cat or a dog, Oscar works tirelessly in his search for the smoothest animations. Regardless
          of the time of day, but preferably in the evening or night. Preferably at night. Really preferably at
          night.</p>

        <h3>Ulrika "Rakka" Einebrant</h3>
        <p>While wandering around in Visual Studio Code, every now and then some working code comes into place.
          Don't ask her how. But since chaos is a bit of a natural state, it should probably work out fine.</p>
