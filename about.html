          <p>
            Hey! I'm Linda and currently a student at Technigo. I think
            accessibility is important because the internet should be accessible
            to everyone, but also because it improves the experience for
            everybody.

          <p>
            Hi! My name is Cathi and I am currently studying JavaScript at
            Technigo. I have always dreamed of learning programming and I am
            very happy that I had the opportunity to start this course in
            January. I think that this project we are working on right now is
            super important and very interesting.
