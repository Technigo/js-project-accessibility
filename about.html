          Currently a student at Technigo, studying their JavaScript Bootcamp.
          I think accessibility is important because the internet should be
          accessible to everyone, but also because it improves the experience
          for everybody.

        <p>Hi! My name is Cathi and I am currently studying JavaScript at Technigo. I have always dreamed of learning
          programming and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to start this course in January. I think that this
          project we are working on right now is super important and very interesting.</p>
